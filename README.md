##Getting Started
If you want to test in your localhost, you must have installed ***NodeJS***, ***MongoDB***, ***Sass*** with ***Compass*** and alternatively ***GruntJS***.

If you have not installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) before, be sure to check out this [link](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation); it explains how to install a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in a different platforms.

This project works with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) framework to compile CSS. Before install, you have to install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).

Also, to install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) you can follow this [link](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/); it is the explanation for installing on all the environments.

Finally, if you have not used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [getting started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to install it.

Then, you have to type the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ikerib/ikerdev.git blog
    $ cd blog
    $ npm install
    $ grunt

Now, you should type in your favourite browser the following url and that's all!

    http://localhost:3000/

This blog contains some fixtures such as four articles and the user admin for a better test. These are the credentials:
    
    email (posta eletktronikoa): user@gmail.com
    password (pasahitza)       : 123456
