##Getting Started
If you want to test in your localhost, you must have installed ***NodeJS***, ***MongoDB*** and alternatively ***GruntJS***.

If you have not installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) before, be sure to check out this [link](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation); it explains how to install a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in a different platforms.

Also, to install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) you can follow this [link](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/); it is the explanation for installing on all the environments.

Finally, if you have not used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [getting started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to install it.

Then, you have to type the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/benatespina/blog.benatespina.git blog

    $ grunt

Now, you should type in your favourite browser the following url and that's all!
